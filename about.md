# My Story

I grew up in a small, sleepy 
[town in rural Serbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosjeri%C4%87). My first 
music purchase was a pirated copy of Kylie Minogue’s Fever, which I played on 
repeat on my Sega Dreamcast.

At the age of ten, I moved to Toronto with my family, where I spent my teenage
years listening to Stars and Metric.

My move to Montreal at 18 coincided with Arcade Fire’s rise to fame and so the
Suburbs became the soundtrack to my frigid, romantic Montreal. [or: as I fell in
love with Montreal’s frigid, industrial cityscape.]

At 20, I spent a year abroad in Berlin, where I fell in love with electronic
music, and discovered the magic of unconventional music venues: lofts and
warehouses, abandoned lots, former squats and art galleries. I loved the freedom
and spontaneity of the city.

When I came back to Montreal, I discovered an underground scene I never knew
existed: secret parties in former textile factories and St Henri warehouses, a
vibrant music scene that bubbled just beneath the surface: that special je ne
sais quoi that helped propel acts like Grimes to stardom.

Starting my Master’s back in Toronto, I decided to find out what it was that
made Montréal so special, and how other cities can learn from it. How do we keep
the music playing?
