# "Good Vibes": The Role of Alternative Nightlife in Montreal

My Master's thesis examines the role of alternative nightlife in the 'creative city' through a case study of underground loft and warehouse parties in the city of Montreal. Drawing on a set of interviews with promoters, musicians and volunteers, I argue that a unique set of circumstances make Montreal a suitable host for alternative forms of nightlife: its openness to foreign influences, a supportive cultural milieu, plenty of post-industrial spaces and relatively light police intervention. However, Montreal’s future as a ‘nightlife city’ rests on its ability to recognize and address a legacy of restrictive and outdated regulations. **Interested?

# Ontario Cultural Attractions Fund

As part of my freelance work for the Ontario Cultural Attractions Fund (OCAF), I designed a clean MailChimp [template]({{ site.baseurl }}/public/docs/newsletter.html), an infographic, and an interactive map. I currently manage the biweekly newsletter, which serves to promote upcoming OCAF-funded events, as well as communicate announcements and news from the cultural sector.
