# "Good Vibes": The Role of Alternative Nightlife in Montreal

My Master's thesis examines the role of alternative nightlife in the 'creative city' through a case study of underground loft and warehouse parties in the city of Montreal. Drawing on a set of interviews with promoters, musicians and volunteers, I argue that a unique set of circumstances make Montreal a suitable host for alternative forms of nightlife: its openness to foreign influences, a supportive cultural milieu, plenty of post-industrial spaces and relatively light police intervention. However, Montreal’s future as a ‘nightlife city’ rests on its ability to recognize and address a legacy of restrictive and outdated regulations.

I presented my research findings of at the 2016 American Association of Geographers conference in sunny San Francisco, California. Take a look at my poster below, created using Adobe InDesign.
