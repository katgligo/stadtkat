# Hello!

My name is Katarina, but you can call me Kat.

I’m passionate about music policy, nightlife, cities, and cats. As a recent
Master’s graduate, I’ve been looking for work that aligns with my goal of
supporting local artists and music spaces. This is why I think FACTOR is the
right place for me.

Take a look around for some examples of my writing, design and cat-spotting
