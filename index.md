# Hello!

### My name is Katarina, but you can call me Kat.


### I’m passionate about music policy, nightlife, cities, and cats. As a recent Master’s graduate, I’ve been looking for work that aligns with my goal of supporting local artists and music spaces. This is why I think FACTOR is the right place for me.


### Take a look around for some examples of my writing, design and ###[cat-spotting](https://www.instagram.com/p/BIBeIyHAxFB_DMO43ryohjUrN36cCT_pOVLQaE0/?taken-by=stadtkat) skills.
